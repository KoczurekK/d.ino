# D.ino
Ever wanted to play that dino game from Google Chrome while still being connected to internet? Well, that's why websites like chromedino.com exist. I was just really bored and learning D, there wasn't actually any point in writing it, but hey, why not?

# Plans for the future
Literally none. I may make some kind of a pathetic, badly-balanced RPG out of it. Or I'll abandon it tomorrow, seriously, I have no idea.

# Submissions
Feel free to open pull requests etc., if your formatting isn't an ungodly abomination and I like it, it'll probably be merged.

# Usage
- Fetch d.ino: `dub fetch dino`
- Go to the install path, on linux it's `.dub/packages/dino-x.x.x/dino/`
- Exectute `dino` file.

Support for `dub run dino` is missing because d.ino uses a relative path to access its assets. Something will be done with it soon. Maybe.
