# D.ino
Ever wanted to play that dino game from Google Chrome while still being connected to internet? Well, that's why websites like chromedino.com exist. I was just really bored and learning D, there wasn't actually any point in writing it, but hey, why not?

# Plans for the future
Literally none. I may make some kind of a pathetic, badly-balanced RPG out of it. Or I'll abandon it tomorrow, seriously, I have no idea.

# Submissions
Feel free to open pull requests etc., if your formatting isn't an ungodly abomination and I like it, it'll probably be merged.

# Building
Make sure that you have DSFMLC installed, then you simply build it with dub. Like that: `dub build`. You may need to pass some additional flags to the linker if you're using Windows. Or not, who knows.
